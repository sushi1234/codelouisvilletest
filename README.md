Description of my Project: 
It's hotel project for customers to check in through website.
It updates current date and time everytime the webpage loads. 
I have built a hamburger menu to go to diffent pages like picture gallery and contact form.
and  i have included one clickable which allows to change color of background of webpage. 
If you hover on menu list it changes to red tamato color. 
I have also added validation of first name , lastname and emaili in contact4 .html. If we leave blank, it will show the message that we can't leave blank and when we enter the first name and last name it will shw the name and count all the alphabets in first name and last name. then it add all the letters and show the total number of alphabets.
