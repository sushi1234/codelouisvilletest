Description of my Project: 
I have tried to create a hotel website project for customers use. Some of the
Project requirements as follows.

* created Javascript function Date() in script.js to updates date and time everytime page(Index.html) loads on right side of panel container.
* Created a form for (services.html) to validate the input email in @ format only. More validation in (contact4.html) are form fields which can't leave blank.
* used css selector in services.html to change background color of each row when we click the top menu.
* Images scroll through (gallery.html) horizontally in picture gallery(gallery.html).
* Javascript math operations like concatenation of first name and last name shows when we click submit button  in (contact4.html) and it adds up all the alphabets and shows the number.
* added hamburger menu to go to diffent pages like home, picture gallery, contact form and service pages.
* Included three clickable buttons to change background color webpage.
* If you hover on menu list all the menu list changes to red tamato color. 

As this is my first website project I am still working on it to improving more in lot of different ways.
Thank you.
