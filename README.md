Description of my Project: 
It's hotel website project for customers to check in and check out.
It updates current date and time everytime the webpage loads on right side of panel container. 
Website has a hamburger menu to go to diffent pages like home, picture gallery, contact form and service .
and  i have also included three click buttons to click it and it changes the color of background of my webpage. 

If you hover on menu list it changes to red tamato color. 
I have also added some validation form in contact page for first name , lastname and emaili(contact4 .html.) If we leave blank the form field then it will show the message that "we can't leave it blank" and when we enter the first name and last name and click submit button then it will show the firstname and lastname. it will count all the alphabets in first name and last name. then it adds up all the alphabets and show the total number of alphabets.

When you click gallery option in menu list then it will take you to some picture gallery and all pictures are scrolling through the pages horizontally. 

As this is my first project I am still working on it to improving it more in lot of different ways.
Thank you.
