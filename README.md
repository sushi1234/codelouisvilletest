Description of my Project: 
I have tried to create a hotel website project for customers use. Some of the
Project requirements I tried to follow.

* Created Javascript Date() fuction in (script.js) to update date and time everytime webpage(Index.html) loads on right side of panel container.

* Created css validation to validate the input email only @ format in (services.html). Created javascript validateform1() fuction for validation in (contact4.html) form fields which can't leave blank by user.

* I have used css selector in services.html to change background color of each row when we click the top menu.

* Images scrolls through (gallery.html) horizontally in picture gallery(gallery.html).

* Used Javascript math operations like concatenation of first name and last name. when we click submit button  in (contact4.html) and it adds up all the alphabets and shows the total number of alphabets and firstname space lastname.

* Added hamburger menu to go to diffent pages like home, picture gallery, contact form and service pages.
* Included three clickable buttons to change background color webpage.

* If you hover on menu list all the menu list changes to red tamato color. 

As this is my first website project I am still working on it to improving more in lot of different ways.
Thank you.
