Description of my Project: 

I have tried to create a hotel website project for customer use. Some of the following
functionality I have tried to implement in my project..

* Added hamburger menu styling in main.css. his menulist go to different pages like Gallery.html, Contact4.html and Services.html.

* Included javascript function to change the background color of webpage by clicking three different color buttons. 

* Created css validation to validate the input email only @ format only in (services.html). 

* Created javascript validateform1() fuction for validating in (contact4.html) form fields which can't leave blank by the user.

* Used CSS selector in services.html to change background color of each row when we click the top menu in this page.

* Images scrolls through (gallery.html) horizontally in picture gallery(gallery.html).

* Used simple Javascript math operations like concatenation of first name and last name. when we click submit button  in (contact4.html) and it adds up all the alphabets and shows the total number of alphabets and firstname space lastname.

* If you hover on menu list all the menu list changes to red tamato color. 

As this is my first website project I am still working on it to improving more in lot of different ways.
Thank you.
