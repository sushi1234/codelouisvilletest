Description of my Project: 
I have tried to create a hotel website project for customers to check in and check out. I just ike to get our attention to look for some of the functionality in my webpage.

This website updates current date and time everytime the webpage loads on right side of panel container. 
I added one hamburger menu to go to diffent pages like home, picture gallery, contact form and service pages.
I have also included three clickable buttons to click it and changes the color of background of my webpage.I tried to spend most of my time to work on style4.css to make webpage looks better. If you hover on menu list all the menu list changes to red tamato color.

 I have also added some validation in contact form page. It accepts first name , lastname and emaili(contact4 .html.) from user. And some of the validation are as follows. If we leave blank the form field then it will show the message that "we can't leave it blank" and when we enter the first name and last name and click submit button then it will show the firstname and lastname and It concatenates first name and last name and It also adds up all the alphabets in first name and last name and shows the total number of alphabets.

When you click gallery option(Gallery.html) in menu list then it will take you to some picture gallery and all pictures are scrolling through the pages horizontally. 

As this is my first project I am still working on it to improving it more in lot of different ways.
Thank you.
