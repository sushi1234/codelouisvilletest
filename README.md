Description of my Project: 

I have tried to create a hotel website project for customer use. Some of the following
functionality I have tried to implement in my project..

* Added hamburger menu styling for (Index.html) connected to styling file in (main.css). menu icon is on the top left side of webpage. if you click it , it shows the hidden Menulist and it allows to click and go to different web pages like gallery.html, Contact4.html and Services.html. 

* Added javascript function to change the background color of webpage by clicking three different color buttons included in hamburger menulist. 

* Added Javascript function in (script.js)to update the date and time on (Index.html) webpage in right panel container. It shows time in interval of seconds.

* Created table form fields in (contact4.html) and added javascript validate() function in (script.js)for validating form fields in (contact4.html) which can't leave blank by the user and enter the email address,zipcode in right format only.

* Created css validation to validate the input email @ format only in (services.html).

* Used CSS selector in (services.html) to change background color of each row when we click different menus on top of the services.html webpage.

* Images scrolls through (gallery.html) horizontally in picture gallery(gallery.html).

* If you hover on menu list all the menu list changes to red tamato color. 

As this is my first website project I am still working on it to improving more in lot of different ways.
Thank you.
